Command;Explanation
cp -u --update somefile(s) target_dir;Copies somefile(s) unless there is a *newer* file with the same name in target_dir.
cp -a --archive somefile(s) target_dir;Copies somefile(s) with the original permissions and ownerships (the default is putting the ones of the user issuing the command)
cp -i --interactive somefile(s) target_dir;Prompts the user to confirm before overwriting any file
cp -v --verbose somefile(s) target_dir;Display what's been done
ls -li directory;Shows the files in a directory in long format, *but the first column is a unique identifier of the data of a file*. If two files share the same "inode" number, one was created as a hard link.
info;Like the man pages but with hyperlinks and friendlier explanations. This is a GNU addition, may not work in all distros. Type `info info` and hit H for a list of keyboard shortcuts
type somecommand;Tells you whether somecommand is a shell builtin, an alias, and so on. Useful also to see if there exists a command with that name
